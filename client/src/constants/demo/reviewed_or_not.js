        title: 'Okay Okay, buy only at low price',

            Pros:<br />
            1. Very good battery life - goes 1.5 days with approximately 8-9 hrs SOT. Will go 2 days<br />
            if your SOT is below 4. For me it has been alternating 2 days to 1.5 days.<br />
            2. Audio - Audio from headphone jack and usb-c both is very good. Speakers are not so good,<br />
            lacks bass and is not rich.<br />
            3. Clean Software - At the start you have bloatwares installed which can be completely uninstalled.<br />
            Good moto features like secure folder and family space.<br />
            4. Smooth Experience - I do not game or use any social media apps (except YT) so for me the processor<br />
            is ample smooth. No lags or jitter (till now).<br />
            5. Connectivity - Has good connectivity and shows 5G+. But auto switching seems slow.<br />
            Have seen that it shows 5G+ but the internet connectivity is very slow. GPS is also good.<br />
            6. Has sd card support (though its hybrid).<br />
            7. Has charger and back cover in the box. No screen protector applied.<br />
            <br />
            Cons:<br />
            1. Camera: Gets the job done. That's it. Nothing to boast about.<br />
            Supports 60fps for 1080p videos (which is good as it has OIS).<br />
            2. Software: No Moto Unplugged, ReadyFor feature. Also no App lock, dual app or speed indicator.<br />
            Need to install separate software for it.<br />
            3. No WiFi tethering. Cannot create hotspot using WiFi. Only using mobile internet<br />
            hotspot can be done.<br />
            4. Only 1 android update.<br />
            5. IPS LCD display - Personally for me, I wanted LCD display. But for some this would be a con.<br />
            Also under sunlight the screen is not visible, so brightness for me is a big let down.<br />
            6. Weight and Height - Not exactly a con, but can mobile manufacturers make 6 inch screen phones?<br />
            Not a one hand device and cannot use for long time as it is heavy.<br />
            <br />
            For me the difference was negligible. It really makes no sense to buy flagship or mid-range phones nowadays as<br />
            everything is a compromise - no charger, no back cover, no headphone jack, no sd card support.<br />
            Except for camera and some software features in S21FE I felt no difference at all!!!<br />
