        message: "Look here I will give you honest review\nPros-\n-display is awesome at this price range with curved and smooth display ( I like curved display more than than flat)\n- brightness is also good\n-Battery is awesome for normal use, and good for gaming\n- charging speed also best 0-100 in just 50-55 minutes\n- ai camera feature is too good\n-camera is also good but not that much\n- performance is also good bcz it has snapdragon processor which gives long lasting performance after years\nCons-\n-Back design is so average like 11-12k mobiles (I hate big camera phones)\n-heat slightly like warm while normal use (not too much)"
