    title: 'Okay Okay, buy only at low price',
    message: "Pros:\n1. Very good battery life - goes 1.5 days with approximately 8-9 hrs SOT. Will go 2 days if your SOT is below 4. For me it has been alternating 2 days to 1.5 days.\n2. Audio - Audio from headphone jack and usb-c both is very good. Speakers are not so good,\nlacks bass and is not rich.\n3. Clean Software - At the start you have bloatwares installed which can be completely uninstalled.\nGood moto features like secure folder and family space.\n4. Smooth Experience - I do not game or use any social media apps (except YT) so for me the processor\nis ample smooth. No lags or jitter (till now).\n5. Connectivity - Has good connectivity and shows 5G+. But auto switching seems slow.\nHave seen that it shows 5G+ but the internet connectivity is very slow. GPS is also good.\n6. Has sd card support (though its hybrid).\n7. Has charger and back cover in the box. No screen protector applied.\n\nCons:\n1. Camera: Gets the job done. That's it. Nothing to boast about.\nSupports 60fps for 1080p videos (which is good as it has OIS).\n2. Software: No Moto Unplugged, ReadyFor feature. Also no App lock, dual app or speed indicator.\nNeed to install separate software for it.\n3. No WiFi tethering. Cannot create hotspot using WiFi. Only using mobile internet\nhotspot can be done.\n4. Only 1 android update.\n5. IPS LCD display - Personally for me, I wanted LCD display. But for some this would be a con.\nAlso under sunlight the screen is not visible, so brightness for me is a big let down.\n6. Weight and Height - Not exactly a con, but can mobile manufacturers make 6 inch screen phones?\nNot a one hand device and cannot use for long time as it is heavy.\n\nFor me the difference was negligible. It really makes no sense to buy flagship or mid-range phones nowadays as\neverything is a compromise - no charger, no back cover, no headphone jack, no sd card support.\nExcept for camera and some software features in S21FE I felt no difference at all!!!"
