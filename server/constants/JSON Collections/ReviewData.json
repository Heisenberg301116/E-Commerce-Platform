I found that the phone lags during multitasking, and the screen brightness isn’t great for outdoor use. The camera is also subpar, with photos coming out grainy, especially in low light. I expected a bit more for this price, and I’ll likely be looking at other options next time. It’s okay for basic use, but not much beyond that.",
